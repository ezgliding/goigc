In total there are more than 6 million flights phases recorded.\n\n## Gliding\n\nGliding is a leisure aviation activity and sport where pilots fly unpowered aircraft known as gliders or sailplanes.\n\nThe principle of gliding is to climb using some sort of lift and convert the altitude gained into distance. Repeating this process allows for very long distance flights, often above 500km or even 1000km - the current [free distance world record](https://www.fai.org/record/7605) being just over 3000km in Patagonia. This is the same process birds follow to reduce the amount of effort required to travel great distances.\n\nThe most used sources of lift include:\n* thermals: where the air rises due to heating from the sun, often marked by cumulus clouds at the top\n* wave: created by strong winds and stable air layers facing a mountain or a high hill, often marked by lenticular clouds\n\nwith thermalling being by far the most common, and this dataset reflects that.\n\n![](http://www.flybc.org/thermals2010.jpg)\n\n## Data Recorders\n\nWhen flying pilots often carry some sort of GPS recording device which generates a track of points collected every few seconds. Each point contains fields for latitude, longitude and altitude (pressure and GPS) among several others, often stored in [IGC](http://www.ukiws.demon.co.uk/GFAC/documents/tech_spec_gnss.pdf) format. Often these tracks are uploaded to online competitions where they are shared with other pilots, and can be easily visualized.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ezgliding/goigc/master/docs/images/track.png)\n\nThe data available in this dataset was scraped from the online competition [Netcoupe](https://netcoupe.net). The scraping, parsing and analysis was done using [goigc](https://github.com/ezgliding/goigc), an open source flight parser and analyser."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Getting Started\n\nLet's start by loading the different files in the dataset and taking a peek at the records.\n\nThe available files include:\n* flight_websource: the metadata exposed in the online competition website, including additional information to what is present in the flight track\n* flight_track: the metadata collected directly from the GPS/IGC flight track\n* phases: the flight phases (cruising, circling) calculated from the GPS/IGC flight track (this is a large file, we load a subset below)\n* handicaps: a mostly static file with the different handicaps attributed to each glider type by the IGC, important when calculating flight performances"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import datetime\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport random\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/tmp/gliding-data'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"flight_websource = pd.read_csv(\"/tmp/gliding-data/flight_websource.csv\")\nflight_track = pd.read_csv(\"/tmp/gliding-data/flight_track.csv\")\nflight_phases = pd.read_csv(\"/tmp/gliding-data/phases.csv\", skiprows=lambda i: i>0 and random.random() > 0.5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Flight Metadata\n\nThere's a lot of information contained in the two flight metadata files (websource and track)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"flight_websource.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"flight_track.head(1)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The most useful information comes from the *websource* file as this information is passed directly by the pilot when submitting the flight to the online competition.
